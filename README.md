# Syrup
Github repo containing all of the entry contents for the HackTheU2020 Hackathon. 

## Syrup is a credit card that helps users maximize the rewards by calculating all of the transactions for the month and rewards customers for their top three categories. This is achieved using Galileo's API to simulate credit cards and transactions.

## Key Features:

### Automatic Optimized Cash Back Rewards
At the end of the month, we calculate all of the transactions in that month and reward customers for their top three categories. Instead of customers chosing their 3%, 2% and 1% cash back teirs, we do it for them by seeing where they spend the most and giving the customer the most cash back compared to other credit cards. 

### Over Limit Protection
A customer can choose how much they want as limit before they are locked out of their card until they pay off their credit card. This feature protects users from unwanted Over Limit fees that may occur when they go past their credit limit/balance. In short, the feature temporarily freezes a customer's card if they are approaching their limit that they set.

### Bonus Cash Back
After the first month, each user will have their top categories are calculated. As a result, the user will be presented with bonus cash back to incentivize spending in different categories. Essentially based on categories they spent less on to steer them towards trying something new and different from their normal routines.
